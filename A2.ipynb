Once you have logged in with GitHub, you may need to select your email address to associate your GitHub account with your email address (if you haven't done it in a previous COMP3420 activity). If you can't find your email address, please skip this step and contact diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au so that he can do the association manually.\n",

Only you and the lecture will have access to it. The repository will be listed under the list of repositories belonging to this offering of COMP3420: https://github.com/orgs/COMP3420-2024S1/repositories\n",
    "5. In contrast with assignment 1 and the practical sessions, your assignment repository will be empty and will not include starter code. you need to add this Jupyter notebook and commit the changes.\n",
